# passwordChecker

In this program, we have build a password checker. This program is legitimately going to be the most secure way for you to check if your password has ever been hacked. So when you run this progran in command prompt, and give ["python3 <filename> <password1> <password2> <password3>"] any passwords we have and check if the passwords are ever been hacked. So this project will check as many passwords as we list in terminal(after the <filename>), and if you run it, it actually checks whether the given passwords got hacked before, with total count of the password been hacked, and give a warning message to change password. If the password is not been hacked, then you get a message as 'Carry On!'. Thus we can use this tool in our real life to check if your password is secure.


--> n.b. "You now have a tool that works and that can even check your passwords. To make sure that you're being secure online. Now a bit of a caution here that I want to note is that right now we're entering the passwords in the command prompt(or terminal). It may sometimes actually save these commands. If you remember pressing up arrow, you see that we get my passwords back. So somewhere on your computer, this is being saved. Maybe that's not super secure because somebody might have or acquire access to it. So a good way to perhaps for you to improve this program is to read these passwords from a text file, instead of a command line argument."
