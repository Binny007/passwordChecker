# passwordChecker

In this program, we have build a password checker. This program is legitimately going to be the most secure way for you to check if your password has ever been hacked. So when you run this progran in command prompt, and give ["python3 <filename> <password1> <password2> <password3>"] any passwords we have and check if the passwords are ever been hacked. So this project will check as many passwords as we list in terminal(after the <filename>), and if you run it, it actually checks whether the given passwords got hacked before, with total count of the password been hacked, and give a warning message to change password. If the password is not been hacked, then you get a message as 'Carry On!'. Thus we can use this tool in our real life to check if your password is secure.
